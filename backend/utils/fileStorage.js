//
// Render's free tier gives the server an EPHEMERAL disk — it is wiped on
// every redeploy AND every time the service spins down after inactivity.
// Anything written to backend/uploads is therefore temporary, which is why
// uploaded bills kept quietly disappearing. Cloudinary's free tier (25GB, no
// credit card) gives us permanent URLs instead.
//
// Google Drive was the obvious first choice, since the app already has a
// Google service account — but service accounts have ZERO Drive storage
// quota of their own, and uploading into a folder that a real user shares
// with them does NOT help: the file still counts against the service
// account, not the folder's owner. The two official fixes (domain-wide
// delegation and Shared Drives) both require paid Google Workspace, which
// this business doesn't have. Hence Cloudinary.
//
// If the Cloudinary variables aren't set, we fall back to the old
// local-disk behaviour so local development — and a server that hasn't been
// configured yet — keep working instead of erroring.
