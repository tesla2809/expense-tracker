// Sending email from this app, and why it works the way it does.
//
// THE PROBLEM: Render's free tier blocks outbound traffic on the SMTP ports
// (25, 465, 587) — a change they made in September 2025. Gmail SMTP therefore
// cannot connect at all from the live backend. It doesn't fail fast either;
// the connection just hangs until it times out, which is why "Sending..."
// appeared to freeze and why password-reset emails silently never arrived
// even with EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD set correctly.
//
// THE FIX: send over HTTPS instead. Brevo's transactional API is a plain POST
// to port 443, which no host blocks — 300 emails a day free, and a normal
// Gmail address can be the verified sender, so no domain is needed.
//
// SMTP is kept as a fallback because it works fine locally, where nothing is
// blocked. Set BREVO_API_KEY and the app uses the API; leave it unset and it
// falls back to Gmail SMTP.
